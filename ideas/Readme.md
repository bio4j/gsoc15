### Submitting your proposal

There are three key aspects that should shine through your proposal:

1. **enthusiasm** for the idea
2. a **viable** work plan
3. **why you** will be able to go through it; **code** is the best way to do that

Some of the ideas are a bit open-ended, because we cannot possibly hope for exactly the right person to implement them: **change** them! What we want is something that will fit you and the project.

And at any rate, get in contact with us, as soon as possible: it would help you to save time and increase your opportunities.
