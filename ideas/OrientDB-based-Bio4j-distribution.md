## OrientDB based Bio4j distribution

- **difficulty** _medium_
- **technologies** _aws, s3, ec2, orientdb, scala, java_

Given the caracteristics of OrientDB (it's one of the few databases that can support local indexes, see orientechnologies/orientdb#1895 a specific implementation would be really interesting: There is even interest on their side on using bio4j as a benchmark.

### Expected outcome

A bio4j distribution based in OrientDB, taking advantage of all its specific features. This will include the corresponding AWS import, data distribution and deployment infrastructure. At least the core UniProtKB module should be implemented
