## Range based data in Bio4j

- **difficulty** _medium / hard_
- **technologies** _Java, Scala, graphs, blueprints++, data structures, biology_

It would expand the applications for bio4j to begin to incorporate range-based data, using adequate indexing data structures which in most cases could be stored themselves as a graph. This would allow bio4j to be used in the genomics field more readily by enabling range-based queries (overlaps with genomic features) and rich annotation queries in the same highly flexible graphdb framework.

### Expected outcome

A set of Bio4j modules incorporating biologically meaningful range-based data, together with the corresponding APIs for accessing it and making efficient stabbing/range queries over them.
